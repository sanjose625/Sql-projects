 # SQL Music Store Database

This project involves analyzing a  Music Store Database using PostgreSQL, a powerful relational database management system. By leveraging the capabilities of SQL, we can efficiently handle large datasets and gain valuable insights into customer churn behavior.

## Project Overview

Here I have tried to solve the project in 2 sections easy and intermediate where I  have tried to answer all questions by using sql

## Question Set 1 - Easy 

1. **Customer with the Highest Number of Purchases**: To find the customer with the highest number of purchases, we can use a SQL query that aggregates the total number of purchases for each customer and then selects the one with the highest count.

2. **Countries with the Highest Number of Customers**: To determine the countries with the highest number of customers, we can use a SQL query that groups customers by their countries and calculates the count of customers in each group. We then select the countries with the highest counts.

3. **Top 3 Values of Total Invoice Amount**: To identify the top 3 values of the total invoice amount, we can use a SQL query that sorts the invoices by the total amount and retrieves the top 3 values.

4. **City with the Best-Selling Albums**: To find the city with the best-selling albums, we can write a SQL query that counts the number of album purchases for each city and returns the city with the highest count.

5. **Top-Spending Customer**: To determine the top-spending customer, we can use a SQL query that calculates the total amount spent by each customer on purchases and then selects the customer with the highest spending.

## Question Set 2 - Moderate

1. **Pop Music Listeners**: To get the email, first name, last name, and genre of all Pop Music listeners, we can use a SQL query that filters customers based on their genre preference and returns the required fields ordered alphabetically by email.

2. **Top 10 Artists with the Highest Track Counts**: To invite the artists with the most tracks in the dataset, we can write a SQL query that aggregates the track count for each artist and selects the top 10 artists with the highest track counts.

3. **Tracks with Shorter Song Length**: To return all track names with a song length shorter than the average song length, we can use a SQL query that calculates the average song length and filters the tracks accordingly. The result will be ordered by song length in ascending order.
