# SQL Projects

Welcome to my SQL Projects repository! In this repository, you'll find a collection of SQL projects where I solve various questions and explore datasets using Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio and PostgreSQL.

## Projects

### Project 1: Store Database Exploration

Description: This project involves the exploration of a fictional store database named Store_Database_Project. The database contains tables for customer sign-ups, product information, and sales transactions. The project includes SQL queries to retrieve insights and answer specific questions about the store's data.

### Project 2: Music Store Database

This project is a data analysis project for a music store, aimed at understanding and gaining insights from the store's music-related data. The data is stored in a relational database and contains information about customers, invoices, tracks, genres, and artists. The goal is to perform various SQL queries to answer specific business questions related to customer behavior, popular music genres, top artists, and more.
